I've just read an awesome article by ThoughtWorks on [building personal technology radar](http://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/build-your-own-technology-radar), and decided to sketch out my own list.

In 2014 I had to learn more new things then I did during the previous 9 years of my web development career. Here is the list of keywords that mark a passing year for me and a few expectations for the next year.

##Q1 2014
Typography, usability and design in general.

##Q2 2014

Rethinking frontend development:

* Mobile first
* [Atomic design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/), [BEM](http://bem.info/), [OOCSS](https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss/wiki)
* [Living styleguides](http://alistapart.com/article/creating-style-guides)
* [NoPSD](http://thoughtworks.github.io/p2/issue02/continuous-design/), Designing in browser, together with designer

##Q3 2014

Began learning [TYPO3 Neos](http://neos.typo3.org/) and all that follows:

* Flow
* Neos
* TypoScript2
* TYPO3CR
* Eel, FlowQuery, Fizzle

##Q4 2014

Joined the Neos team for [code sprint in Denmark](http://dimaip.github.io/2014/10/05/the-code-sprint/). Learned more in a week then during the whole previous year.

* Switched to Linux and started developing locally
* New PHP skills: Test Driven Development, coding guidelines, etc.
* Advanced Git stuff
* Composer
* Bower
* Grunt
* Docker for local development (ditched Vagrant altogether)
* Surf deployment
* [Contineos delivery with CircleCI](http://dimaip.github.io/2014/12/20/three-steps-to-deploy/)
* Finally... Learned to touch-type in English!


##2015

And here are things I want to learn in 2015:

* Do [RESS with Neos](https://github.com/ttreeagency/Ttree.Ress)
* Use [ElasticSearch with Neos](https://github.com/Flowpack/Flowpack.ElasticSearch.ContentRepositoryAdaptor)
* [PaaS with Docker](http://thenewstack.io/docker-is-driving-a-new-breed-of-paas/)
* Testable frontend: CSS critic + PhantomJS + BeHat
* Work more Agile, but more organized
* Learn more about Google Analitics & A/B testing and data-driven development in general

But all of this technology matter only when you put users first, and build websites worth reading. I hope all of this technology put together will help us build great websites for great people, that's [what we work so hard for](http://dimaip.github.io/2014/12/06/sfiru-goes-live/), after all...
